# School_District_Analysis
Module 4 - UCB Extension course "Pandas and Jupyter Notebook" with Anaconda Python3.7

In this module's lesson "PyCitySchool"
(https://github.com/daneshtavana/School_District_Analysis/blob/master/PyCitySchools.ipynb) 
we merged two Excel .csv data sets "School" (https://github.com/daneshtavana/School_District_Analysis/blob/master/Resources/schools_complete.csv) 
and "Student" (https://github.com/daneshtavana/School_District_Analysis/blob/master/Resources/students_complete.csv) 
in order to analyze the impact of varoius parameter on student scores. In the challenge code "PyCitySchool_challenge"
(https://github.com/daneshtavana/School_District_Analysis/blob/master/PyCitySchools_Challenge.ipynb) 
we replaced some of the student's scores with NaN to see how the overall results change. The summary of observations can be found in "Summary"
(https://github.com/daneshtavana/School_District_Analysis/blob/master/Summary.docx).
