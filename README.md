# School_District_Analysis
Module 4 - UCB Extension course "Pandas and Jupyter Notebook" with Anaconda Python3.7

In this module's lesson "PyCitySchool" () we merged two Excel .csv data sets "School" and "Student" in order to analyze the impact of varoius parameter on student scores. In the challenge code "PyCitySchool_challenge" we replaced some of the student's scores with NaN to see how the overall results change. The summary of observations can be found in "Summary".
